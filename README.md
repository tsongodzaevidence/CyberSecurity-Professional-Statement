# CyberSecurity-Professional-Statement

As a Cybersecurity Analyst with a passion for threat intelligence and vulnerability
management. I am committed to the core values such as data protection,
disaster recovery, ethical hacking principles and compliance advocacy.
Having strengths in analytical problem solving helps me to identify critical
vulnerabilities before exploitation and to develop robust security architectures.
I'm particularly drawn to systems security because I am to leverage the passion
to help organisations to achieve zero-trust implementations and regulatory
compliance.This alignment of skills, ethics and dedication allows me to deliver
actionable intelligence and resilient systems that advance business continuity
and customer trust.
